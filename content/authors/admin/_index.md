 I am Ph.D. Candidate in Statistical Science at Duke University. I am interested in **Bayesian factor model, nonparametric Bayesian and applications in neuroscience**. My goal is to **serve as a bridge** to connect various disciplines through developing statistical methods and models, and **spread the concepts of statistics** to the general public.
